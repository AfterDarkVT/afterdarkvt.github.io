Lots of mommy issues huh. My mum started talking again. But she is tired of me and won't reply much. She wants me to give them a heads up on any "major decision". Obviously she means about getting married to Linh. I think I liked a reddit post about this: "It's already decided! She's getting married to me! I love her and I'm happy with her!"
