> or as long as I can remember my parents were miserable. Their misery was not without cause - see: poverty, abuse, displacement. But their misery also manifested in unacceptable emotional and physical abuse towards their children.
>
> For a very long time I genuinely believed that I was one “right” decision away from healing their well of sadness. Like I was one move away in the choose-your-own-adventure of fixing my family’s intergenerational trauma. It took me a lifetime of “right” decisions and behaving in “acceptable” ways, often at the expense of my own mental health and joy (see: abusive jobs, partners) to realize that nothing I do will ever be enough for them. There is no “there.”

> Friends, I don’t know who needs to hear this and I will risk sounding like jade-egg using self-help guru to say this but Gwenyth be damned…

> Life is weird and hard and we all have our own crosses to bear. Never forget that regardless of how much your APs have mutilated your access to joy, it’s still there. And it’s completely your own:
>
> 1. Regardless of what your APs tell you - you do not determine whether or not they can access joy. I love you fellow subredditor but you do not have that kind of power. You are not a mystical joy goblin.
> 2. The joy your parents tell you that they get from your compliance is not joy. It’s just temporary relief. A frail emotion. It will not last very long.
> 3. You are allowed to feel joy even when your family unit can’t. It is not selfish that your joy is just *yours* and not *theirs* or *ours* It is beautiful and wholly unique and belongs to just you. The people in your life who love you (or will love you) will never demonize you for accessing your joy. <3
