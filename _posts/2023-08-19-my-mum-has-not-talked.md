I don't think she understands how much anguish she is inflicting upon me.

<!--break-->

Maybe she does, but then I don't know if that is cruel or not. I think she thinks I am cruel to her. I don't know how to communicate to her in a way that won't hurt each other. I should read more about non-violent communication. 

I just read yesterday about Guess vs Ask culture. I do think it's exhausting to do all that "guessing", it's very very complex
and tiresome. I can see people being all up in arms about this. Guess culture probably think Ask people as rude.

A friend sent information about [high vs low context cultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-context_and_low-context_cultures) and that's pretty much it.

I would send questions every day - which she asked me to - and then she responds with one word answer. Even when she does it I don't do things like that. I think there must be moments where she wants to disown me.
