I wake up not too late, not too early, preferably without an alarm. I am calm and alert, but not necessary upbeat on my morning commute so I can enjoy the early day. At work I do fulfilling work, a little bit out of my comfort zone so I will be learning but not so intense that I feel frustrated or out of my depth. I joke around with my colleagues, we trade stories, become friends, build each other up. I go home a little early and catch the bus just before the going home crowd gets out. My wife would be at the bus station waiting for me as we walk home. She would have likely already made dinner if she does wait for me at the station so that I can eat immediately once I'm home. Dinner would be accompanied by the late night shows of US tv's, a combination of news and humor. I would open some YouTube videos to watch/listen while washing dishes. We might go for a little walk after dinner together. We might go see a movie, or watch a show. Or we might just come home and choose something on streaming. Or maybe we do our own thing, separate but together in the same space. At around 10 or 11, I would get tired and close my laptop and we would snuggle on bed, scroll on the internet together, then turn off the lights and fall asleep.
